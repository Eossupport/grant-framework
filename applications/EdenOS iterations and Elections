### Overview

> Please provide the following:

- **Name:** EdenOS iterations.
- **Brief Description:** EdenOS is an open-source code. The code is used to run genesis-edeneos. Genesis edeneos needs multiple code modifications in order to run elections. Our goal is to modify edenos so that the genesis edeneos community could use the code to run their election. 
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** EdenOS runs on the EOS mainnet 
- **Reason for Interest:** We are interested in working on this project inorder to continue the experiment that started the edenOS development.
